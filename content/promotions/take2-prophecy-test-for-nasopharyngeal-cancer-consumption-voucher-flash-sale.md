Persistent headaches, tinnitus and nasal blockage may make you wonder if you have caught a cold or allergic rhinitis? However, these symptoms could be signs of early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC)! Therefore, patients can easily be misled and ignore the condition, and realising they need medical intervention only when the condition deteriorates. According to research, 80% of unscreened patients were diagnosed with late-stage NPC1, leading to adverse consequences.

Starting from today, do not make any guesses about your health! By making good use of your consumption voucher, get tested with Take2 Prophecy™ Test for NPC in a meal time, you would no longer need to worry about it!

**Choose an accurate and reliable test**

Take2 Prophecy™ Test for NPC applies the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, which effectively enables NPC patients to be identified in their early-stage for timely treatment. The Test has >97% sensitivity¹ ², with superior test performance than other similar tests!

The higher the test sensitivity, the lower the chance of missing patients with NPC, which means the test is more reliable. Hence, the test sensitivity is an important indication.

On the other hand, the higher the false-positive rate, the more non-NPC individuals are reported as "diseased", which exposes healthy individuals to unnecessary mental burden and additional medical procedures.

**Only takes a lunch hour to complete the cancer detection test**

Adopting the NGS technologies, Take2 Prophecy™ Test for NPC breaks the traditional concepts of “cancer detection test” that requests hospitalisation, taking day off from work, visiting a specialist and undergoing tissue biopsy. Instead, the early NPC detection test is simple and convenient. By taking a blood draw at your nearest clinic and spending only a lunch hour, you could have the test done right away!
