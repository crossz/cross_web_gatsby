In pursuit of following the prudent strategies for long-term business development, Take2 Health (hereinafter referred to as "we" or "our company") has officially settled in Qianhai Kerry Centre, Shenzhen, in 2021 year-end. The settlement marked a significant milestone as we established the first operating base outside the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Furthermore, by making early nasopharyngeal cancer (“NPC”) detection services widely available in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (“GBA”), we are dedicated to continuously improving the overall health of the general public.

**Shenzhen office in the prime location equipped with a high standard laboratory capable of serving a large**

Located in the prime area of Qianhai, our office and laboratory is adjacent to the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Yanjiang Expressway, giving our company geographically distinctive and favourable advantages which at the same time attract plenty of high-tech companies and talents. Our state-of-the-art medical laboratory (over 2,000 sq.m.) upholds laboratory quality control standards according to The National Basic Standards and Management Specifications for Medical Laboratory, ISO15189 and CAP. From a long-term perspective, we expect to provide services to the vast population in the GBA and across China with a large-scale operation.

**Deep-rooted in Hong Kong, we are determined to co-build the league to fight against nasopharyngeal cancer in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area**

Tony Yung, CEO of Take2 Health, said: “In the light of the Central Government’s promulgation of 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives for 2035, it is vital to promote the cooperation along the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Corridor. With the guidance and assistance provided by the Qianhai Administration, we are grateful to be successfully settled in the GBA now. While Hong Kong is where we started, the GBA will be another base for providing our service. Our company is dedicated to becoming the pioneering force in the early cancer detection industry by providing our accurate and reliable early cancer detection service. In addition, we are determined to facilitate shaping the GBA area to be the NPC “early detection and early treatment” model region. Furthermore, our company is committed to co-build the league to fight against NPC with top universities and hospitals to improve the well-being of the public.
