title: Take2 Health invites Eric Cheung to explain his cancer survival story
detail: 'Hong Kong-based healthcare tech startup Take2Health has launched a campaign
  to introduce a product for nasopharynx cancer testing and is featuring actor Eric
  Cheung Tat-ming, who is also a survivor of the cancer.  Titled "Go Live Again",
  the campaign includes a video telling the story of Cheung who details the narrative.
  After unveiling his face as the voice of the campaign, Cheung apologises for his
  unclear voice since he cannot speak as quickly and clearly as he could before, post
  his survival of the cancer. He then shares openly with the audience on his prior
  lack of knowledge on nasopharynx cancer and thought that the cancer would not have
  anything to do with his life. '
