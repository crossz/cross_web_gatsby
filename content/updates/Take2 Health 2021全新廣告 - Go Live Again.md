Hong Kong-based healthcare tech startup Take2Health has launched a campaign to introduce a product for nasopharynx cancer testing and is featuring actor Eric Cheung Tat-ming, who is also a survivor of the cancer. Titled "Go Live Again", the campaign includes a video telling the story of Cheung who details the narrative. After unveiling his face as the voice of the campaign, Cheung apologises for his unclear voice since he cannot speak as quickly and clearly as he could before, post his survival of the cancer. He then shares openly with the audience on his prior lack of knowledge on nasopharynx cancer and thought that the cancer would not have anything to do with his life.

Jay Ng, founder of creative agency SO DON’T BORE, explained the idea of the campaign, saying, "Instead of showcasing his face at the very beginning of the campaign video, we understand that Cheung's voice, which is different from his original voice due to damages done by therapies, is far more impactful."

Ng also told MARKETING-INTERACTIVE there were eight different concepts the team mulled with. For example, one idea was to explore "CantoCancer" derived from the word "Cantopop." Nasopharynx cancer is sometimes referred to as Cantonese cancer (廣東癌) because it occurs in about 25 cases per 100,000 people in this region, 25 times higher than the rest of the world, according to a study conducted in the 2000s. Although the idea includes rearrangement of CantoPop lyrics to help raise awareness, it was later kept on the backburner as the team hoped to target a wider audience instead of just the younger segment.

As Cheung is a survivor of nasopharynx cancer, Take2Health believed that using his narratives would be impactful, helping retain viewers to stay and learn more about its product. More importantly, Cheung's narratives can serve as an advice, explained the team.

"The public knows that Cheung went through years of battle against nasopharynx cancer. He finally recovered and adopted a healthy lifestyle," Ng said.

The campaign, running until January 2022, includes multiple touchpoints such as social media platforms, banner ads, media advertorials, Google search ads and OOH ads. Since the launch on 11 October, the video has about 361,000 views on YouTube at the time of writing.

Take2Health said the campaign can drive awareness on nasopharynx cancer, which is also the main goal of the campaign in 2021. It added that data gained from this campaign will be used by the company to brand better understand the target audience's behaviours, enabling the brand to further develop a marketing plan for the next year.

"We will explore different segments and we are going to develop further specific marketing communication messages catered to different stages of the consumer journey. Apart from driving more conversions in Hong Kong, we hope to expand into China and even other Asian markets in 2022 as well," the company said.
