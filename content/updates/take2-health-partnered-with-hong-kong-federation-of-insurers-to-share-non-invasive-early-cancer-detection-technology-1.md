Supported by the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers (“HKFI”), an industry sharing themed “Screening for Early Cancers by Circulating DNA Analysis”, was successfully held on 17 September 2021. The online seminar attracted more than 180 senior managements from 37 insurance companies and led to heated discussions.

The seminar invited the respected professor in the pathology field from the Chinese University of Hong Kong as keynote speaker, to introduce how the pioneering Next-generation Sequencing technology help with early cancer detection. During the talk, the professor explained the development progress of this state-of-the-art technology and discussed how insurance companies and their products could create synergies together when incorporated with the technology, with an aim to safeguard the population’s health.

HKFI was established on 8 August 1988 to advance and promote the development of the insurance business in Hong Kong. Fully recognised by the HKSAR government, HKFI is the representative body of the insurance industry.
