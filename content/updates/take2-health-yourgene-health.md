Take2 Health (“Take2”) and Yourgene Health (“Yourgene”) have reached a partnership to offer the clinically-validated Take2 Prophecy™ Test for Nasopharyngeal Cancer (“NPC”) in Taiwan region, as well as to establish a medical network for the collection of clinical specimens.  In addition, the two parties have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to consider granting rights to allow Yourgene to perform the test in its local laboratory. 

Under the agreement, Take2 aims to facilitate early diagnosis and timely treatments of NPC with Yourgene’s extensive region-wide medical service networks. Yourgene will be responsible for driving local clinical demand, working with clinicians and healthcare professionals in promoting early cancer detection, and advocating its importance to the general public.
